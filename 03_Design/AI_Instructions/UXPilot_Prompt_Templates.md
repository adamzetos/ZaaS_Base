# UXPilot Prompt Templates - Component-First Design System
**Classification: ZETOS-CONFIDENTIAL ‚ñ≤**  
**Created: 2025-05-24**  
**Version: 2.1**  
**Purpose: Component-based AI design generation for consistent IT systems**

## üìã Overview

This document provides UXPilot prompt templates following a component-first approach. By establishing a comprehensive component library FIRST, then referencing it in all subsequent page designs, we ensure consistency across the entire project.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Character Limits (Tested & Verified)

### Actual Limits:
- **Context Box**: 8,000-10,000 characters ‚úÖ (Much larger than expected!)
- **Page Description**: 3,000 characters ‚úÖ (Plenty of room for details)
- **Flow Input**: 500-800 characters ‚ö° (Keep concise, rely on context)

### Optimization Strategy:
1. **Maximize Context Box** - Include complete design system (8-10k chars available!)
2. **Detailed Page Descriptions** - Use the full 3k for comprehensive specs
3. **Concise Flow Descriptions** - Let the rich context carry the consistency

## üéØ Critical Workflow Order

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Follow this exact sequence:
1. **Generate Component Library** (Template 1) - MUST DO FIRST
2. **Document/Screenshot Components** - Save for reference
3. **Generate Layout Templates** (Template 2) - Basic page structures
4. **Design Individual Pages** (Templates 3-6) - Always reference component library
5. **Use Edit Feature** - Refine any inconsistencies

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### If components don't match:
1. Use Edit feature to correct
2. Reference specific component by name
3. Provide exact specifications

### If new component needed:
1. First check if existing component can work
2. If not, generate separately matching system
3. Add to component library documentation

### If consistency breaks:
1. Return to component library reference
2. Use Edit feature with specific instructions
3. Explicitly state "match our component library"
