II. Comprehensive Description for Claude Code Implementation üìã
Project Title: Adam Zetos Development Studio - Complete Workflow Standardization System
Project Scope: Create a comprehensive, standardized development workflow management system that encompasses all phases of IT project delivery, from initial system analysis through final QA testing. The system will provide structured procedures, automated checklists, conflict detection mechanisms, and standardized deliverable frameworks for consistent project execution across multiple technology stacks.
Technical Architecture Requirements:
Document Management System with version control integration
System Analysis Engine with automated validation and conflict detection
Design Workflow Manager with VI compliance automation
Task Generation System with resource allocation optimization
Multi-Platform Development Standards (Bubble, Webflow, React, etc.)
Backend Architecture Framework with service generation capabilities
QA Testing Suite with automated test case generation
Deliverable Structure:
Standardized templates and checklists for each workflow phase
Automated validation scripts and conflict detection algorithms
Resource planning and task distribution frameworks
Integration protocols for GitHub and local development environments
Quality assurance and compliance checking mechanisms
