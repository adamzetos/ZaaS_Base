**Classification: ZETOS-CONFIDENTIAL ‚ñ≤**  
**Created: 2025-05-24**  
**Version: 1.0**

## üìã Overview
Comprehensive procedures for System Analysts to identify, analyze, and resolve conflicts in business logic, technical requirements, and project workflows before they impact development.

## üéØ Purpose
- Detect conflicts early in the requirements gathering phase
- Prevent costly rework during development and testing
- Ensure logical consistency across all project components
- Provide systematic approach to conflict resolution
- Create audit trail for conflict resolution decisions

## üîç Types of Conflicts to Detect

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Business Logic Conflicts
**Definition**: Contradictions in business rules, processes, or requirements

#### Common Examples:
- **Circular Dependencies**: Process A requires completion of Process B, but Process B requires completion of Process A
- **Contradictory Rules**: "All orders must be approved by manager" + "Urgent orders can bypass approval"
- **Impossible Conditions**: "Complete within 24 hours" + "Requires 5-day approval process"
- **Permission Conflicts**: User role has conflicting access rights to the same data
- **Data Integrity Issues**: Business rules that would create invalid data states

#### Detection Methods:
```
WORKFLOW MAPPING
- Map all process flows end-to-end
- Identify decision points and approval steps
- Check for circular dependencies
- Validate all possible process paths

RULE MATRIX ANALYSIS
- List all business rules in matrix format
- Cross-reference rules for contradictions
- Identify exception handling gaps
- Validate rule precedence order

SCENARIO TESTING
- Create "what if" scenarios
- Test edge cases and exceptions
- Simulate high-volume situations
- Test conflicting simultaneous events
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Technical Conflicts
**Definition**: Incompatibilities in technical requirements, systems, or constraints

#### Common Examples:
- **Performance vs Security**: "Sub-second response time" + "Multi-factor authentication required"
- **Scalability vs Budget**: "Support 10,000 users" + "Budget only supports 1,000-user infrastructure"  
- **Integration Conflicts**: System A exports data in XML, System B only accepts JSON
- **Platform Conflicts**: "Must work on IE11" + "Requires modern JavaScript framework"
- **Data Conflicts**: Same data element defined differently in multiple systems

#### Detection Methods:
```
TECHNICAL MATRIX REVIEW
- Map all technical requirements
- Cross-reference system capabilities
- Identify integration points and formats
- Validate performance vs resource requirements

ARCHITECTURE VALIDATION
- Review system architecture diagrams
- Validate data flow compatibility
- Check API compatibility between systems
- Verify security model consistency

CONSTRAINT ANALYSIS
- List all technical constraints
- Check constraint compatibility
- Validate resource requirements
- Verify deployment environment compatibility
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Process Conflicts
**Definition**: Incompatibilities in workflows, procedures, or organizational processes

#### Common Examples:
- **Authority Conflicts**: Multiple people have "final approval" authority
- **Timing Conflicts**: Process requires daily updates but data only available weekly
- **Resource Conflicts**: Same person responsible for conflicting roles
- **Workflow Gaps**: Process step requires input that no previous step provides
- **Escalation Loops**: Escalation process that creates circular escalations

#### Detection Methods:
```
RACI MATRIX VALIDATION
- Create RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) matrix
- Validate no conflicts in accountability
- Ensure all steps have clear ownership
- Check for gaps in responsibility

TIMELINE ANALYSIS  
- Map all process timelines
- Identify dependency conflicts
- Check for impossible timing requirements
- Validate resource availability

STAKEHOLDER MAPPING
- Map all stakeholders to processes
- Identify conflicting interests
- Check for missing stakeholders
- Validate decision-making authority
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Data Conflicts
**Definition**: Inconsistencies in data definitions, ownership, or flow

#### Common Examples:
- **Definition Conflicts**: "Customer" means different things to Sales vs Finance
- **Ownership Conflicts**: Multiple systems claim to be "source of truth" for same data
- **Format Conflicts**: Same data stored in incompatible formats
- **Timing Conflicts**: Real-time system needs data that's only batch-updated daily
- **Access Conflicts**: Compliance requires data isolation but business requires data sharing

#### Detection Methods:
```
DATA DICTIONARY REVIEW
- Create comprehensive data dictionary
- Validate consistent definitions across systems
- Check for duplicate or conflicting definitions
- Verify data relationship integrity

DATA FLOW MAPPING
- Map data flow through all systems
- Identify transformation points
- Check for data loss or corruption points
- Validate synchronization requirements

MASTER DATA ANALYSIS
- Identify all master data entities
- Validate single source of truth for each entity
- Check for data ownership conflicts
- Verify data governance rules
```

## üîß Conflict Detection Process

REQUIREMENT CONFLICT MATRIX
Create matrix with all requirements and check each pair for conflicts:
- Req A vs Req B: Compatible/Conflicting/Dependent/Independent
- Document specific conflict details
- Rate conflict severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- Identify affected stakeholders
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Scenario Testing**
```
CONFLICT SCENARIOS
Test these scenarios for each requirement set:
- Best case scenario
- Worst case scenario  
- Peak load scenario
- Failure scenario
- Edge case scenario
- Simultaneous event scenario
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Cross-Functional Review**
```
REVIEW SESSIONS
Conduct structured reviews with:
- Technical team: Architecture and integration conflicts
- Business team: Process and rule conflicts
- Compliance team: Regulatory conflicts
- Security team: Security vs functionality conflicts
```

#### Deliverables:
- Conflict identification matrix
- Scenario test results
- Cross-functional review notes
- Prioritized conflict list

### Phase 3: Conflict Analysis
**Objective**: Understand root causes and impact of identified conflicts

#### Activities:
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Root Cause Analysis**
```
5-WHY ANALYSIS
For each conflict, ask "Why" 5 times:
- Why does this conflict exist?
- Why wasn't it identified earlier?
- Why are the requirements contradictory?
- Why can't both requirements coexist?
- Why is this requirement necessary?
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Impact Assessment**
```
IMPACT MATRIX
For each conflict, assess:
- Project Timeline Impact: [Days/Weeks delayed]
- Budget Impact: [Additional cost in $]
- Quality Impact: [Risk to deliverable quality]
- Stakeholder Impact: [Which stakeholders affected]
- Technical Impact: [Architecture/performance impact]
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Dependency Mapping**
```
CONFLICT DEPENDENCIES
Map how conflicts relate to each other:
- Which conflicts must be resolved first?
- Which conflicts are symptoms of deeper issues?
- Which conflicts affect multiple requirements?
- Which conflicts impact critical path?
```

#### Deliverables:
- Root cause analysis report
- Conflict impact assessment
- Dependency relationship map
- Resolution priority matrix
