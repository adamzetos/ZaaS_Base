**Version: 1.0**

## üìã Overview
Comprehensive framework for validating requirements, deliverables, and project outcomes throughout the system analysis phase and beyond.

## üéØ Purpose
- Ensure accuracy and completeness of all SA deliverables
- Provide systematic validation approach for requirements
- Establish quality gates before phase transitions
- Enable early detection of errors and omissions
- Create audit trail for validation decisions

## üîç Validation Principles

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Validation vs Verification
**Validation**: "Are we building the right thing?"
- Does it meet business needs?
- Will it solve the actual problem?
- Does it deliver expected value?

**Verification**: "Are we building the thing right?"
- Does it meet specified requirements?
- Is it technically correct?
- Does it follow standards?

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Multi-Level Validation
**Level 1**: Individual requirement validation
**Level 2**: Requirement set consistency validation  
**Level 3**: System integration validation
**Level 4**: Business value validation

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Stakeholder-Centric Validation
- Business stakeholders validate business value
- Technical stakeholders validate feasibility
- End users validate usability
- Compliance teams validate regulatory adherence

## üìä Validation Framework Structure

### Phase 1: Requirements Validation
### Phase 2: Design Validation
### Phase 3: Process Validation
### Phase 4: Deliverable Validation
### Phase 5: Handoff Validation
